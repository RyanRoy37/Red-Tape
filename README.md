<h2>🔍 Introduction</h2>

<p>
In the rapidly evolving digital world, phishing continues to be one of the most widespread and deceptive cyber threats. 
Attackers craft fake websites, emails, and login portals to exploit human trust and steal sensitive information such as 
credentials, banking data, and personal details. With the increasing dependency on online transactions, 
the consequences of phishing have become more severe, leading to significant financial and reputational losses for individuals 
and organizations alike.
</p>

<p>
According to the <b>2024 Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report</b>, phishing was involved in over 
<b>36% of all confirmed data breaches</b> worldwide, and the <b>FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3)</b> 
reported losses exceeding <b>$1.2 billion</b> due to phishing-related scams in a single year. These numbers are projected to grow 
as threat actors continuously refine their tactics using automation and AI-driven deception.
</p>

<p>
To address this ever-evolving challenge, <b>Red-Tape</b> will be developed as an intelligent browser extension that detects and 
prevents phishing attempts in real time. It will analyze URLs, domains, and file downloads using a hybrid machine learning 
approach integrated with global threat intelligence APIs such as VirusTotal. The system will provide instant alerts and 
explainable decisions to users, aiming to enhance online safety and build digital trust across the web.
