<h1 align="center">Detecting Phishing Websites by Using a Hybrid Method of Page Content and Formal Concept Analysis<h1>

<h2> Abstract</h2>
<h3>With the increasing threat of phishing websites, how to judge whether a website is a phishing website has become a research hotspot. However, there are few researches on phishing websites corresponding to a specific kind of website. In order to detect phishing websites of specific websites, this paper proposes a new method. This method carries out TF-IDF analysis on a given website, extracts some words to represent the website, and constructs a formal concept lattice on this basis. After TF-IDF analysis, some words are extracted from the website to be detected and compared with each concept in the formal concept lattice. Therefore, we can pick up an optimal concept, identify phishing websites and inform the owners of specific websites. Experiments show that this method can effectively identify phishing websites.</h3>

<h2> Abstract</h2>
<h3>In recent years, phishing attack methods have demonstrated characteristics of strong anti-detection abilities, resulting in significant economic losses. Traditional phishing website detection methods suffer from limited features and insufficient information, no longer meeting the practical requirements for effective security protection. To address complex and variable network phishing attacks, we propose a phishing website detection method based on multimodal large language models (LLMs). The different modalities of website features are transformed into text features by LLMs. The problem of detecting phishing websites is transformed into a text classification problem. The method we propose improves phishing website detection performance through the multimodal fusion of website information. Experimental evaluation on a public dataset demonstrates the method’s effectiveness, achieving an F1 score of 96.1%.</h3>
